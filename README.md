⚡ My fun fact: I was inspired to pursue a degree in Computer Science after experiencing the 'Unsupervised' exhibition at MoMA in New York. This collection features real-time, dynamically generated art created by StyleGAN algorithms, drawing from 200 years of the museum's archive. How cool is that? 🚀
